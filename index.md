## Details

An AED is a device used to provide a shock of electricity to somebody in cardiac arrest (having a heart attack). Defibrillation is the definitive treatment. Knowing how to use an AED is an important skill for firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, nurses, doctors and general public.

AED Sim gives people a chance to see, hear and interact with an AED. If you have ever been curious about how one operates now is your chance.

The built-in scenario editor lets you create a custom scenario or it can generate a random scenario for you. Combine an iPhone or iPad and AED Sim and you ºve got an inexpensive realistic training environment for practicing CPR. No costly AED trainers needed.

Designed and built by a former Canadian paramedic with 20 years of software development experience.
