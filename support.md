### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Is it available in any other language?** At this time the app is localized into US English and UK English. My intent is to localize it into many more languages. Right now you can use the profile editor to change the display prompts and voice messages to any language. These files are saved in the app's Profiles directory which can be shared with others.

1. **What happened to iDefibrillate?** This is the successor of the original Objctive C app I released in 2010. AED Sim has been completly rewritten using the latest Apple technologies and renamed to use a more practical name.
